# rock-paper-scissors
## Introduction (Written before starting project)
This project is a simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors written in Javascript, that can be played in the console of any web browser's developer tools. The game can be played against a computer opponent, who randomly chooses one of the three options. The player can choose their own option, then the two are compared and a winner is declared (or a draw declared in case of a draw).

I foresee this as being a pretty simple project for me to handle. I have quite a bit of general programming experience (especially in the field of game design and programming), as well as a decent amount of experience with debugging Javascript. Considering that this is just meant to be played in the console, and there's nothing graphical involved in it (or anything other than basic logic), I assume it'll be a very easy project to knock out quickly.
